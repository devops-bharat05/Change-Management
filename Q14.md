# What is the difference between Emergency Change Requests and  Instantaneous change request?

The terms **Emergency Change Requests** and **Instantaneous Change Requests** refer to different types of urgent changes in IT and change management contexts. While both deal with rapid responses, there are key differences in their definitions, processes, and management.

### Emergency Change Requests

**Definition:**
- **Emergency Change Requests (ECRs)** are changes that need to be implemented urgently due to critical situations that could severely impact business operations or security. These changes are often unforeseen and require immediate action to mitigate risks or resolve major issues.

**Characteristics:**
- **Urgency:** ECRs are typically initiated in response to incidents or emergencies that demand immediate attention.
- **Impact:** The impact of ECRs is usually significant, affecting key systems, services, or security.
- **Approval Process:** While ECRs bypass some standard approval procedures due to their urgent nature, they still require a rapid approval process. This may involve an Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB) or senior management.
- **Post-Implementation Review:** ECRs are subject to a post-implementation review to assess their effectiveness and document lessons learned. This helps ensure that the changes are properly documented and analyzed for future reference.

**Examples:**
- Fixing a critical security vulnerability that is being actively exploited.
- Addressing a major system outage that affects business continuity.
- Implementing emergency patches or updates to prevent a system failure.

### Instantaneous Change Requests

**Definition:**
- **Instantaneous Change Requests** refer to changes that need to be implemented immediately, often in real-time, without prior notice or planning. These are typically applied to address immediate needs or to make adjustments that cannot be scheduled.

**Characteristics:**
- **Urgency:** Instantaneous changes are required to be made in real-time or as quickly as possible, often without a formal request process.
- **Impact:** The impact can vary, but the key factor is the need for immediate execution rather than a planned approach.
- **Approval Process:** There is usually no formal approval process for instantaneous changes. These are often carried out by the technical team or system administrators who have the authority to make on-the-fly adjustments.
- **Documentation:** While instantaneous changes may not go through formal documentation processes before implementation, they should still be recorded and reviewed afterward for tracking and accountability.

**Examples:**
- Quickly adjusting system settings to address an urgent performance issue.
- Making real-time changes to configurations in response to immediate user requests or problems.
- Applying emergency fixes that require instant deployment to keep operations running smoothly.

### Key Differences

1. **Planning and Documentation:**
   - **ECRs:** Follow a structured, albeit expedited, process with documentation, risk assessment, and post-implementation review.
   - **Instantaneous Changes:** Often lack formal planning and documentation before implementation, though they should be recorded afterward.

2. **Approval Process:**
   - **ECRs:** Require rapid but formal approval, often through an ECAB or senior management, even though the approval process is accelerated.
   - **Instantaneous Changes:** Typically implemented without prior formal approval, relying on the authority of the person executing the change.

3. **Impact and Scope:**
   - **ECRs:** Address high-impact issues that need urgent resolution but are planned and managed to some extent.
   - **Instantaneous Changes:** Handle immediate, often lower-impact adjustments that are made in real-time to address urgent needs.

4. **Post-Implementation Review:**
   - **ECRs:** Are reviewed post-implementation to assess their impact and effectiveness.
   - **Instantaneous Changes:** May not always have a formal review but should still be evaluated to ensure they achieved the desired outcome.

### Summary
**Emergency Change Requests** involve urgent changes with significant impact that require a rapid yet structured approval process and post-implementation review. **Instantaneous Change Requests** involve immediate, real-time changes with minimal formal procedures and are executed on the spot to address urgent needs or issues. Both types of changes aim to address immediate issues but differ in their approach to planning, approval, and documentation.
