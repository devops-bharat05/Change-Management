# What is the process to be followed in CAB call?

A Change Advisory Board (CAB) is a critical element of the Change Management process in ITIL. It is responsible for reviewing, approving, or rejecting change requests that have a significant impact on IT services or business operations. The CAB call or meeting brings together stakeholders from various parts of the organization to ensure that changes are properly vetted before implementation.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the **process to be followed during a CAB call**:

### 1. **Preparation Before the CAB Call**

#### a) **Agenda Preparation**
- **Compile the Change Requests (CRs):** The Change Manager compiles a list of all changes that need to be reviewed during the CAB meeting. These changes can be categorized as normal changes, major changes, or emergency changes.
- **Distribute Agenda in Advance:** The agenda, along with detailed documentation of the change requests, should be distributed to CAB members in advance. This includes change details like risk, impact, resource requirements, and implementation plans, giving CAB members enough time to review before the meeting.

#### b) **Review Change Documentation**
- CAB members are expected to review the change requests and supporting documentation (impact analysis, risk assessment, backout plans) before the meeting to provide informed feedback during the call.
  
### 2. **Opening the CAB Call**
The Change Manager is usually responsible for conducting the CAB call. The meeting should begin with a quick introduction to the purpose of the call and a review of the agenda.

#### a) **Welcome and Attendance**
- **Attendance Check:** Confirm the attendance of key stakeholders, including representatives from relevant departments like IT, operations, security, business, and others.
- **CAB Roles:** The Change Manager or CAB Chairperson leads the meeting, while members contribute by providing their expertise in reviewing each change.

#### b) **Review of Previous Actions**
- **Review Open Actions from Previous CAB Meetings:** Any outstanding actions or incomplete changes from prior meetings should be discussed, providing updates on their status and outcomes.

### 3. **Presentation of Change Requests (CRs)**
Each change request is presented in a structured manner, focusing on the following key details:

#### a) **Summary of the Change**
- **Description of the Change:** A brief summary of the change, including the reason for the change, what systems or services will be affected, and the desired outcome.
- **Type of Change:** Whether it is a normal, standard, or emergency change, as this affects the approval process.

#### b) **Risk and Impact Analysis**
- **Risk Assessment:** A discussion on the potential risks associated with the change, considering factors such as service outages, customer impact, and compliance.
- **Impact Analysis:** How the change may affect other systems, users, or business processes, both positive and negative.

#### c) **Implementation Plan**
- **Timeline and Resources:** An overview of the implementation timeline, including start and end dates, resources required (personnel, tools, licenses), and any dependencies on other projects or changes.
- **Change Window:** The proposed change window (time during which the change will occur) and whether it is during business hours or off-peak times.

#### d) **Backout/Contingency Plan**
- **Rollback Plan:** The fallback or backout plan in case the change fails. This includes steps for reverting to the previous system state and minimizing impact on services.

#### e) **Testing and Validation Plan**
- **Testing Process:** How the change will be tested (pre- and post-implementation) to ensure it works as expected and does not introduce new issues.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** In cases where end users need to verify the success of the change.

### 4. **CAB Member Discussions and Feedback**
Each CAB member is given the opportunity to ask questions, provide feedback, and discuss the proposed change. Discussion topics typically include:

- **Concerns About Risks or Impacts:** Are there any risks or potential issues that have not been fully addressed?
- **Suggestions for Improvement:** CAB members may suggest modifications to the change plan, such as changing the implementation timeline, improving communication strategies, or revising the risk mitigation approach.
- **Business Perspective:** Business stakeholders may highlight the potential impact on customers, users, or business operations.

### 5. **Change Approval, Rejection, or Deferral**
Once the discussions are complete, the CAB will make a decision regarding each change request:

#### a) **Approval**
- If the change is deemed low risk and all concerns are addressed, the CAB will approve the change. The approval can either be unanimous or majority-based, depending on the organization’s governance model.

#### b) **Conditional Approval**
- The CAB may give conditional approval, meaning the change is approved subject to certain conditions being met (e.g., additional testing, modification of the implementation plan, securing additional resources).

#### c) **Rejection**
- If the change is deemed too risky, lacks proper documentation, or needs significant modification, the CAB can reject the change. In this case, the Change Manager must work with the change requester to revise and resubmit the change.

#### d) **Deferral**
- The CAB may choose to defer the decision on a change request if there is insufficient information to make a decision or if it needs to be coordinated with other changes.

### 6. **Post-Decision Actions**
Once a decision is made, the Change Manager is responsible for the following actions:

#### a) **Documenting the Decisions**
- All decisions (approval, rejection, or deferral) are documented in the Change Management system for future reference. Meeting minutes and any relevant notes from the discussion should also be captured.

#### b) **Communicating the Outcome**
- The outcome of the CAB meeting is communicated to all relevant stakeholders, including the change requester, IT teams, business stakeholders, and any other affected parties.
  
#### c) **Update Change Calendar**
- If a change is approved, the Change Manager updates the change calendar with the scheduled date and time for the change implementation.

### 7. **Post-CAB Review and Follow-Up**
After the CAB meeting, the Change Manager may follow up with specific departments or stakeholders to ensure any conditions or action items are being addressed.

#### a) **Emergency Changes**
- For emergency changes, a separate **Emergency CAB (ECAB)** may be called to handle the immediate approval process outside the regular CAB schedule. Emergency changes are reviewed retrospectively in the next CAB meeting to ensure accountability.

### 8. **Review of Change Results in Future CAB Meetings**
After a change has been implemented, the CAB may review the results in a future meeting, especially for high-risk or high-impact changes. This post-implementation review can help the team identify lessons learned and improve the Change Management process.

### Typical CAB Call Participants:
- **Change Manager**: Facilitates the meeting and ensures that the agenda is followed.
- **Change Requester**: Provides detailed information about the change.
- **CAB Members**: Representatives from various departments, including IT operations, security, business units, finance, etc.
- **Service Owners**: May provide insight into how the change impacts specific services.
- **CAB Chairperson**: In larger organizations, the Chairperson may be responsible for leading the CAB discussion.

### Conclusion:
The CAB call process is essential for managing risk, ensuring stakeholder involvement, and coordinating complex changes. By following a structured approach that includes preparation, discussion, decision-making, and follow-up, organizations can effectively manage changes while minimizing disruptions to business operations.
