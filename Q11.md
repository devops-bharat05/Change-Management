# How the changes are implemented in Symphony Summit AI Tools? 

Symphony SummitAI is an enterprise IT management platform that provides IT service management (ITSM), IT asset management (ITAM), and IT operations management (ITOM) capabilities. When implementing changes in Symphony SummitAI, organizations follow a structured approach that aligns with ITIL best practices, specifically for Change Management. Here's a detailed explanation of how changes are typically implemented within the Symphony SummitAI tools:

### 1. **Change Request Submission**
The change management process in Symphony SummitAI begins with the submission of a **Change Request (CR)**. This can be initiated by end users, IT staff, or automated systems in response to incidents, problems, or planned upgrades.

#### Key Features:
- **Change Request Form:** A form that captures details such as the nature of the change, its impact, risk level, affected services, and a proposed timeline.
- **Integration with ITSM:** The tool integrates with other modules, such as incident or problem management, so that change requests can be raised directly from these modules if necessary.
  
#### Process:
- **Create Change:** The requester provides details about the change, including the type (normal, emergency, or standard), the reason for the change, and the planned schedule.
- **Categorization:** The change request is categorized based on predefined rules (e.g., software upgrade, infrastructure change, etc.).

### 2. **Change Risk Assessment and Approval**
Once the change request is submitted, the change must go through an approval and risk assessment process.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Risk Analysis:** The risk associated with the change is assessed using factors like service impact, complexity, and urgency. Symphony SummitAI offers automated tools to evaluate these risks, ensuring that high-risk changes get more scrutiny.
- **Impact Analysis:** The tool helps assess the potential impact on systems, users, and business processes. For example, it may check which services are affected by a proposed infrastructure change.

#### Approvals:
- **Multi-Level Approvals:** Symphony SummitAI supports multi-level approval workflows based on the change type, urgency, and impact. Approvers may include Change Advisory Board (CAB) members, IT managers, or business stakeholders.
- **Automated Workflows:** The tool can automate the approval workflow, routing the change request to the appropriate approvers, based on pre-configured rules.

### 3. **Change Planning**
After the change is approved, detailed planning takes place.

#### Key Components:
- **Implementation Plan:** A detailed step-by-step plan for implementing the change, including timelines, responsible personnel, and any required resources (e.g., tools, servers, licenses).
- **Backout Plan:** A rollback or contingency plan in case the change fails, ensuring that the system can be restored to its previous state without impacting service delivery.
- **Resource Allocation:** Symphony SummitAI helps with resource management, assigning the right technical staff, project managers, and tools required for the change.

### 4. **Change Scheduling**
The next step is scheduling the change in such a way that minimizes disruption to the business.

#### Scheduling Tools:
- **Calendar Integration:** The Symphony SummitAI tool has a built-in change calendar, which provides a holistic view of all planned changes and their impact on business services. This helps in scheduling changes during low-impact periods.
- **Conflict Detection:** The system can detect scheduling conflicts or resource constraints (e.g., overlapping changes or dependencies), enabling the change manager to adjust the schedule accordingly.

### 5. **Change Implementation**
The actual implementation of the change follows the pre-approved plan. Symphony SummitAI provides features to track and document each step of the change process in real-time.

#### Key Features:
- **Task Management:** The change implementation process is broken down into tasks, each assigned to the appropriate personnel. The tool tracks the completion of tasks and ensures that the change progresses according to the timeline.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** The tool allows for real-time tracking of the change implementation, enabling IT managers to monitor the status of each task and take immediate corrective actions if necessary.
- **Automation Support:** For certain types of changes, such as software updates or configurations, Symphony SummitAI supports automation, enabling changes to be executed with minimal human intervention.

### 6. **Change Validation and Testing**
Once the change has been implemented, it must be validated to ensure that it works as expected.

#### Validation Process:
- **Post-Implementation Testing:** After the change is applied, teams run tests to validate that the change is functioning as intended and that there are no unforeseen issues.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** In some cases, end users or business stakeholders are involved in testing to ensure that the change meets their requirements and does not negatively impact service delivery.
- **Incident Monitoring:** Post-change, the tool monitors for any incidents or performance issues that could indicate that the change did not succeed as planned.

### 7. **Change Closure and Documentation**
After successful validation and testing, the change is marked as complete, and the final documentation is prepared.

#### Closure Process:
- **Documentation:** The change manager documents the details of the change, including the results of the implementation, any issues encountered, and the final status. This is essential for future audits and post-change reviews.
- **Change Review:** For significant changes, a formal post-implementation review (PIR) may be conducted. This review evaluates whether the change met its objectives, identifies lessons learned, and discusses any process improvements for future changes.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** The change manager communicates the completion of the change to relevant stakeholders, ensuring that they are aware of the successful implementation.

### 8. **Post-Implementation Support**
After the change is completed, Symphony SummitAI offers features to support ongoing monitoring and management of the system.

#### Post-Implementation Monitoring:
- **Service Monitoring:** The tool integrates with IT operations to monitor the health of the services affected by the change, ensuring that there are no post-change issues.
- **Incident and Problem Tracking:** Any issues that arise as a result of the change are tracked in the incident or problem management modules, helping IT teams address them quickly.

### 9. **Metrics and Reporting**
Symphony SummitAI provides robust reporting capabilities to measure the effectiveness of the change management process.

#### Metrics and KPIs:
- **Change Success Rate:** Measures the percentage of successful changes versus those that encountered issues or required rollbacks.
- **Change Lead Time:** The time it takes from submitting the change request to the successful implementation of the change.
- **Change Failure Rate:** Tracks the percentage of changes that resulted in incidents, service disruptions, or rollbacks.
- **Audit Trails:** Symphony SummitAI maintains detailed logs of all changes, approvals, and implementations for audit and compliance purposes.

### Summary of Change Management Implementation in Symphony SummitAI:
- **Change Request Submission:** Raise change requests via ITSM integration.
- **Risk Assessment and Approval:** Conduct risk analysis and gain multi-level approvals.
- **Change Planning and Scheduling:** Plan the change steps, assign tasks, and schedule in the change calendar.
- **Implementation:** Track real-time implementation and automate routine changes.
- **Validation and Testing:** Test the change and monitor for incidents.
- **Closure:** Document results and review the change.
- **Post-Implementation Support and Reporting:** Monitor services post-change and use reporting tools for metrics and KPIs.

This structured approach ensures that changes are implemented with minimal disruption and maximum efficiency, ensuring successful outcomes for the organization.
