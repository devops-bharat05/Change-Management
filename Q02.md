## What methodologies or frameworks are you familiar with when it comes to change management (e.g., ADKAR, Kotter's 8-Step Process, Prosci's ADKAR model)?

Here are brief overviews of popular change management methodologies and frameworks:

1. **ADKAR Model (Prosci):**
   - Focuses on managing individual change with five key steps: **Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement**.
   - Goal: Ensures individuals successfully adopt and sustain change.

2. **Kotter's 8-Step Process:**
   - A framework for leading large-scale organizational change with eight steps: **Create urgency, Build a coalition, Form a vision, Communicate the vision, Remove obstacles, Create short-term wins, Build on the change, Anchor the change in culture**.
   - Goal: Focuses on leadership and guiding teams through change.

3. **Lewin's Change Management Model:**
   - A simple model with three stages: **Unfreeze, Change, Refreeze**.
   - Goal: Prepares for change, implements change, and ensures it becomes the new norm.

4. **McKinsey 7-S Framework:**
   - Focuses on seven interdependent factors: **Strategy, Structure, Systems, Shared Values, Skills, Style, Staff**.
   - Goal: Ensures alignment and effectiveness during organizational change.

5. **Bridges' Transition Model:**
   - Emphasizes the emotional and psychological journey through change: **Ending, Neutral Zone, New Beginning**.

Each framework is useful in different contexts, depending on the organization's needs and the scale of the change.
