# What is the change matrix you followed ?

A **Change Matrix** is a tool used in change management to classify and manage different types of changes based on their risk, impact, and complexity. It helps in determining the appropriate approval process, implementation procedures, and monitoring requirements for each change. The matrix ensures that changes are handled consistently and efficiently, aligning with organizational policies and ITIL best practices.

### Change Matrix Overview

#### 1. **Categories of Changes**

The Change Matrix typically includes several categories or types of changes, which may vary by organization. Common categories include:

- **Standard Changes**
- **Normal Changes**
- **Emergency Changes**

Each category is defined based on specific criteria such as risk, impact, urgency, and complexity.

#### 2. **Change Matrix Elements**

The Change Matrix often includes the following key elements:

1. **Change Type:** Classification of the change (e.g., Standard, Normal, Emergency).
2. **Risk Level:** Assessment of the risk associated with the change (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
3. **Impact:** Evaluation of the potential impact on systems, services, or users (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
4. **Urgency:** Degree to which the change needs to be implemented quickly (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
5. **Approval Process:** Description of the approval process required based on the change type and risk level.
6. **Implementation Process:** Steps and procedures for implementing the change, including testing and deployment.
7. **Documentation Requirements:** What documentation is needed before, during, and after the change.
8. **Post-Implementation Review:** Criteria and procedures for reviewing the change after implementation.

#### 3. **Sample Change Matrix**

Here is a simplified example of a Change Matrix:

| **Change Type**  | **Risk Level** | **Impact**  | **Urgency** | **Approval Process**                 | **Implementation Process**             | **Documentation Requirements**              | **Post-Implementation Review**          |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Standard**     | Low            | Low         | Low         | Pre-approved by Change Management    | Follow predefined procedures           | Change request form, implementation checklist | Minimal, if any; routine checks       |
| **Normal**       | Medium          | Medium       | Medium       | CAB review and approval              | Detailed planning and scheduling       | Change request form, impact and risk analysis | Post-implementation review required  |
| **Emergency**    | High            | High         | High        | ECAB or senior management approval   | Immediate action, expedited process    | Emergency change request form, post-implementation documentation | Detailed review and lessons learned  |

#### 4. **Change Matrix Application**

**1. Classification:**
- **Change requests** are classified into the appropriate category based on their characteristics (risk, impact, urgency).
  
**2. Approval Process:**
- Based on the classification, the appropriate approval process is followed. For example, standard changes may only need pre-approval, while emergency changes require urgent approval from ECAB or senior management.

**3. Implementation:**
- The change matrix helps determine the steps and procedures for implementing the change, ensuring that each type of change is handled according to its risk and impact level.

**4. Documentation:**
- Documentation requirements are outlined in the matrix to ensure that all necessary information is captured before, during, and after the change.

**5. Post-Implementation Review:**
- The matrix specifies the need for a post-implementation review based on the type of change, helping to assess the success of the change and identify any areas for improvement.

### Benefits of Using a Change Matrix

- **Consistency:** Ensures that changes are managed consistently according to their risk, impact, and complexity.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlines the change management process by defining clear procedures and approval paths.
- **Risk Management:** Helps in assessing and mitigating risks associated with changes.
- **Transparency:** Provides clarity on the approval process, implementation steps, and documentation requirements for each type of change.

By using a Change Matrix, organizations can effectively manage and prioritize changes, ensuring that they are implemented smoothly while minimizing potential disruptions and risks.
