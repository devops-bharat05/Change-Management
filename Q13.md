# What are the types of change request you get in your orgainisation?

In most organizations, change requests can be classified into several types based on their nature, urgency, and impact. These classifications help in managing and prioritizing changes effectively. Here are the common types of change requests typically encountered in organizations:

### 1. **Standard Change Requests**
- **Definition:** Standard changes are low-risk, routine changes that follow a pre-approved and well-documented procedure. They are generally repetitive and have a low impact on services or systems.
- **Examples:**
  - Routine software updates or patches.
  - Regular hardware upgrades or replacements.
  - User account creation or modification.
- **Approval Process:** Standard changes often do not require CAB approval and can be implemented by IT staff based on predefined procedures.

### 2. **Normal Change Requests**
- **Definition:** Normal changes are those that are not categorized as standard but require assessment and approval before implementation. They can vary in complexity and impact.
- **Examples:**
  - Implementation of a new application or system feature.
  - Changes to existing system configurations or settings.
  - Major updates or enhancements to IT infrastructure.
- **Approval Process:** Normal changes typically go through the CAB for assessment, risk evaluation, and approval. They may involve a detailed impact assessment and a change plan.

### 3. **Emergency Change Requests**
- **Definition:** Emergency changes are urgent changes that need to be implemented immediately to address critical issues or prevent severe service disruptions. They bypass the usual approval process due to their urgent nature but are still subject to post-implementation review.
- **Examples:**
  - Fixing a critical security vulnerability.
  - Resolving a major system outage or service failure.
  - Immediate corrective actions following a severe incident.
- **Approval Process:** Emergency changes may be authorized by an emergency change advisory board or senior management. The usual CAB approval is expedited, and post-implementation reviews are conducted to ensure proper documentation and assessment.

### 4. **Major Change Requests**
- **Definition:** Major changes involve significant modifications to IT systems or infrastructure that can have substantial impacts on business operations. They are often complex and require extensive planning and coordination.
- **Examples:**
  - Overhauling an entire IT infrastructure.
  - Upgrading to a new enterprise system.
  - Implementing significant changes to business processes.
- **Approval Process:** Major changes undergo a thorough assessment by the CAB, including detailed risk analysis, impact assessment, and approval. They may also involve multiple rounds of CAB meetings and extensive planning.

### 5. **Minor Change Requests**
- **Definition:** Minor changes are smaller-scale modifications that are relatively simple and have a low impact. They are less complex than normal or major changes but still require proper documentation and approval.
- **Examples:**
  - Minor adjustments to system configurations.
  - Updates to documentation or procedures.
  - Small enhancements to existing software.
- **Approval Process:** Minor changes may be approved by a designated authority or a change manager, depending on the organizationâ€™s policies. They typically do not require CAB approval but should be documented and tracked.

### 6. **Project-Based Change Requests**
- **Definition:** These changes are associated with specific projects and involve alterations that are part of a larger project scope. They are planned and implemented as part of the project lifecycle.
- **Examples:**
  - Adding new features or functionalities during a software development project.
  - Adjustments to project timelines or deliverables.
  - Integration of new systems or components as part of a project.
- **Approval Process:** Project-based changes are managed within the project framework and may require approval from project stakeholders and project management teams.

### 7. **Compliance-Driven Change Requests**
- **Definition:** These changes are initiated to meet regulatory, legal, or compliance requirements. They ensure that the organization adheres to standards and regulations.
- **Examples:**
  - Implementing changes to meet data protection regulations.
  - Updates required for compliance with industry standards.
  - Modifications needed for legal or contractual obligations.
- **Approval Process:** Compliance-driven changes are typically reviewed and approved by compliance or regulatory teams, in addition to the CAB if necessary.

### **Process for Handling Change Requests**
Regardless of the type, the process for handling change requests generally involves the following steps:

1. **Submission:** Change requests are submitted through a formal process, including details about the nature, impact, and urgency of the change.
2. **Assessment:** Each request is assessed for risk, impact, and resource requirements. This assessment helps determine the change type and necessary approval process.
3. **Approval:** Changes are reviewed and approved based on their type. This may involve the CAB for normal and major changes, an emergency change board for urgent changes, or designated authorities for minor changes.
4. **Implementation:** Approved changes are implemented according to the planned approach, with proper documentation and communication.
5. **Review:** Post-implementation reviews are conducted to evaluate the success of the change, identify any issues, and ensure that the change meets its objectives.

By categorizing change requests into these types, organizations can better manage and prioritize their change management processes, ensuring that each change is handled appropriately and with minimal disruption to operations.
